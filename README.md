# Work Time Tracking and Payroll Database System

This project implements a relational database system for work time tracking and weekly payroll calculation. The main goal of the system is to ensure accurate recording of employees’ work, enforce business rules directly at the database level, and automatically calculate weekly payments based on valid hourly rates and contractual constraints.

The solution combines classical relational database design with temporal and active database concepts. Temporal aspects are used to correctly handle time-dependent data such as work dates and hourly rates, while active database mechanisms (triggers and functions) are used to enforce business rules and maintain data consistency.
